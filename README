Track/Case study: System Programming

Problem Statement: Write a program in a language of your choice which will take a mount point as an argument and return a list of all the files on the mountpoint and their disk usage in bytes in json format.

Eg: getdiskusage.py /tmp

{
"files":
[
{"/tmp/foo", 1000}, {"/tmp/bar", 1000000}, {"/tmp/buzzz", 42},
], }

1. Technical Stack Chosen

Language.  : Python(python>=3)
OS Platform: Linux/macOSX

2. Runnable instance of the implementation on your computer >> 
https://gist.github.com/arunsingh/96f93d626d03672d11a08886477a2904


3. The end result should be a functional implementation of the problem preferably with associated tests.

How to Run
$ sudo chmod +x diskusage_target.py


>> To elaborate more according to the permission level you can change the user/group level permissions to make the usage of tool specific to teams or an individual having marked credentials.

Program use
$ ./file_name 

<$./diskusage_target.py>

$python3 diskusage_target.py

elaborate tests done
#broken symlink identification have been taken care of in the program.
#file permission changes to be done by admin

##### probable test cases to think about:

## diskusage --help
## diskusage
## diskusage /tmp          ### /tmp could be non-existent or invalid directory name, empty directory can default to current working directory, user has no permission to access /tmp.
